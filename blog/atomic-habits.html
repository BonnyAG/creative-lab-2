      <h1>5 things I learned reading Atomic Habits</h1>
      <p class="date">July 23, 2022</p>
      <hr style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      
      <p>About a month ago, Atomic habits helped me change a lot of things in my personal life. I had already been working on improving my habits but I was struggling with being consistent and identifying what kind of habits I should pursue and what falls into the ‚Äòhabit‚Äô category versus a regular goal. This book has been a game changer for me and I‚Äôm hoping to convey some of the themes that have been impactful for me.</p>
      <h2>I. Making 1% improvements</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"It's better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I think I‚Äôm not alone in having had the experience of waking up one day or having some ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment and decide to completely change my life and my routine. Every once in a while those moments have lead to lasting change. Most of the time, however, I can keep those habits going for maybe a week before I give up. While reading this book, I realized that there‚Äôs a better way: Introduce easy-to-do habits and improve them over time. It‚Äôs a lot less daunting to start a habit that will improve my life by just 1% rather than trying to reshape my entire life.</p>
      <h2>II. Habits are like compound interest</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The most frustrating part of developing a habit for me is that I don‚Äôt see most of the results that I‚Äôm expecting immediately which makes it discouraging and often leads me to give up. In the book, James made a really pertinent metaphor: results from habits are like compound interest, it accumulates over time. He suggest to change our mindset from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not seeing any results, this is a dumb habit and it‚Äôs not working‚Äù to ‚ÄúEven though I‚Äôm not seeing results right now, I‚Äôm building up results that will show up eventually‚Äù. This is one of these small pieces of advice that completely changed my approach to habits.</p>
      <h2>III. Becoming vs doing</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The more you repeat a behavior the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We need to think about our habits as voting towards the kind of person we want to become. Anytime we show up to do a habit we are casting a vote towards the kind of person this habit is helping us become. For example, if I had a habit to work on writing a blog post for 10 minutes every day, every time I show up and actually do that, I am proving to myself that I can be (or become) a writer. I think this is a great paradigm shift to avoid simply going through the motions.</p>
      <h2>IV. Habit stacking</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>"Once you've started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Habit stacking is adding a new habit right after a habit you already do regularly which helps you to create a routine and makes it a lot more obvious when you‚Äôre going to perform a particular habit. I think this is one of the most powerful and helpful things I learned from reading this book.</p>
      <h2>V. The 2-minute rule</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>"A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The 2 minute rule means that whenever you are trying to start a new habit, the first step needs to take 2 minutes or less. If it only takes 2 minutes it will be easy to show up every day and then over time we can build it up in the amount of time we want it to get to.</p>
