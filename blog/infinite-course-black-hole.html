      <p>
        Youâ€™re interested in learning how to code but you donâ€™t know where to
        start, what do you do? If youâ€™re anything like me this is how it goes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You start watching hundreds of YouTube tutorials (you're keywords of
          choice are 'crash course' and â€˜for beginnersâ€™)
        </li>
        <li>
          YouTube tutorials are nice but you want more structure so you turn to
          an online course platform (freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Treehouse, you
          name it)
        </li>
        <li>You start a course, but you never finish itâ€¦</li>
        <li>You start another course, but you never finish itâ€¦</li>
        <li>You start another course, but you never finish itâ€¦</li>
        <li>You start another course, but you never finish itâ€¦</li>
        <li>You start another course, but you never finish itâ€¦</li>
        <li>You start another course, but you never finish itâ€¦</li>
        <li>You start another course, but you never finish itâ€¦</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        This last part is what I call the
        <em>Infinite Courses black hole.</em> It's a difficult problem to avoid
        because as a beginner/intermediate developer, you need help to learn how
        your programming language, framework, platforms work but it's easy to
        get stuck in a rut doing course after course after course without
        actually accomplish anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's where I've been for many years. Just to give you an idea of how
        bad it got here's a list of all online course platforms that I've
        used/paid for trying to learn how to code (as far as I can remember).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Codecademy</li>
        <li>Treehouse</li>
        <li>LevelUpTuts</li>
        <li>OpenClassrooms</li>
        <li>Udemy</li>
        <li>Lynda / LinkedIn Learning</li>
        <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
        <li>WesBos Courses</li>
        <li>Kinsta Academy</li>
        <li>HackingWithSwift / 100 Days of SwiftUI</li>
        <li>ITProTV</li>
        <li>Coursera</li>
        <li>Udacity</li>
        <li>SoloLearn</li>
        <li>Khan Academy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And probably a couple more that Iâ€™ve forgotten about...</p>
      <p>
        While many of those platforms are free and the content of those
        platforms is very valuable, getting stuck in the infinite course
        blackhole creates two main problems:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>You're not being productive as a developer</li>
        <li>Youâ€™re not learning as much as you could</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Letâ€™s break it down.</p>
      <h3>You're not productive</h3>
      <p>
        Hereâ€™s what I mean by productive: youâ€™re producing things (apps, GitHub
        repos, websites, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        When youâ€™re doing a course, most of the time you just follow along.
        While some platforms offer labs or practice projects to help you apply
        the concepts youâ€™re learning youâ€™re still not working on your own
        projects and by the end of the course, you usually donâ€™t end up with a
        project you can call your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a big downside when youâ€™re trying to make programming your
        career because THE most important selling point for you as a developer
        is what youâ€™ve already done, your portfolio.
      </p>
      <h3>You're not learning as much</h3>
      <p>
        This is based on my personal experience and learning style but Iâ€™ve
        realized that when I need to solve a problem for one of my own problems,
        my skills tend to improve much faster because Iâ€™m working on a real
        world issue.
      </p>
      <p>Working on real-world products is helpful in two main ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You will most likely encounter the same problem again on another
          project. Once itâ€™s solved, you will know what to do in the future.
          There are patterns in programming that you will encounter over and
          over again. Working your own projects will help you find those
          patterns
        </li>
        <li>Youâ€™ll learn how to use documentation and online resources.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I want to touch more on that last point. The hard part of working on
        your own projects is that any given tutorial might not fix exactly the
        problem youâ€™re facing. That means youâ€™ll need to do some digging on
        documentation sites for your programming language or your framework, you
        might also be looking for solutions on StackOverflow. That learning is
        much more difficult but will mirror your real life experience as a
        developer much more accurately than following along a course.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do we get sucked in?</h2>
      <p>
        If youâ€™re anything like me, your brain works in to-do lists and online
        courses become another element on that to-do list to check off. But the
        problem is that thereâ€™s an infinite amount of courses you can do. you
        will never complete all online courses available and that makes your
        brain freak out.
      </p>
      <p>
        It hurts inside but you need to detach yourself from the need to check
        all the boxes, to complete everything 100%.
      </p>
      <h2>How do we get out?</h2>
      <p>
        Again, this is based on my personal experience, but here is a pattern
        that has worked for me.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Start with a project</h3>
      <p>
        If you donâ€™t have a personal website or blog, start with that. If you
        have other ideas that youâ€™ve been thinking about for a while, work on
        those. Otherwise, check out the Build Your Own X Github repo for more
        ideas.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Prototype your project</h3>
      <p>Make a list of what you need to be able to do to complete that project</h3>
      <p>
        For example, if you want to build a mobile app on iOS, you will need to
        know things like Swift, Swift UI or App Kit, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>3a. If you already know the basics of your chosen platform or programming
          language start working on your project</h3>
      <h3>3b. Otherwise, identify a starter course you can do that will help you get
          started. However set the following rule for yourself:</h3>
      <p><b>I will not copy the project outlined in the course, instead I will
      apply the concepts being taught to my own project.</b></p>
      <p>
        The goal is to work on your own stuff. Not only will it give you more
        things to show off to your future employers or customers, but it will
        also help you learn the process of problem solving you need as a
        real-life developer.
